    - Nondescript clothing in solid colors
    - Multiple layers
    - Long sleeves and pants, covering as much skin as possible
        - Especially any identifiable tattoos
    - Heat-resistant gloves
    - Comfortable shoes that are easy to run in
    - Shatter-proof eye protection (goggles, sunglasses, gas mask, etc.)
    - A mask or bandana to cover your nose and mouth
        - Soak it in water, lemon juice, or vinegar to help breathe during chemical exposure
    - A hat to protect you from the sun and chemical weapons
    - Hair tied up

DON'T Wear:
    - Loose or easily grabbed items, such as jewelry

    - Open shoes, or anything that impedes movement
    - Oils or lotions, as they might trap chemicals against skin
