How to find and verify the legitimacy of a protest in your area


There are many ways to find protests online:


1. Protest Calendars

If you're in a big city (or even some smaller towns), there are likely several sites that compile lists of protests and events in the area.
Simply look up "[city name] protest calendar" with your preferred search engine and check the first few results to get a generalized list of protests in your area. These sites may not always be trustworthy or accurate, so look for links to other sources for the events listed, and to well-known activist groups such as Black Lives Matter.


2. Local Activist Groups

Activist groups tend to be the best source of information if you're looking to support a particular cause. To find one you're interested in, a good starting point is My Civic Workout (https://www.mycivicworkout.com/activist-groups), where you can find a number of large groups organized by category, and links to each of their "get started" pages, which will generally help you find a local chapter and start getting involved. If you're looking for something more localized, there are other sites such as The Action Network (https://actionnetwork.org/groups/search) that allow you to search by keywords or zip codes.


3. Social Media

Although probably the least reliable source, social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook will have announcements and news about protests (especially the more spontaneous ones) before anywhere else. If you're looking to get going right away, it may be worthwhile to keep an eye on trending hashtags and the pages of activist groups to see if anything is happening currently.
