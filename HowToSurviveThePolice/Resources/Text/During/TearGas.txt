What to do if you come into contact with tear gas/how to take care of someone who has been teargassed

Tear Gas is a chemical agent frequently used against protestors across the world. Despite the name, tear gas is not a gas. It's an extremely fine powder that doesn't only irritate your eyes and throat, but your skin as well.

What to DO:
  1. If you or someone else is experiencing an asthma attack, seek medical attention.
    - Unless you are a professional, you are likely not qualified to help in these situations.
    - Attempt to get yourself and the asthmatic parties to a clear and ventilated area, then call for medical help as soon as possible.
  
  2. Leave the area immediately.
    - A well-ventilated area is key to recovering from tear gas.
  
  3. Let the effects happen.
    - Your eyes will water and sting, your throat will swell and cough, but your body will flush out the chemical.
  
  4. Clean off your arms.
    - If you have access to enough water and a rag, carefully clean your arms off as thoroughly as you can. This will prevent accidentally exposing yourself and others to the chemical agent again.
    - If you're washing off in a fountain of some sort, make sure not to pollute that water source with the chemicals on you. The last thing you want is to expose other people or animals to the substance.
  
  5. Keep your hair off of your face/out of your eyes.
    - The dust will still be in your hair after an attack. Sweating will cause the particles to trickle back down on to your face, causing you to suffer the effects again.
    
What to BRING:
  1. Shatter-proof goggles
    - These can prevent getting tear gas in your eyes. No brainer, but sometimes we need help with the obvious.
  
  2. Mouth and nose protection
    - A bandana can help for a limited time, same with scarves and t-shirts used as masks.
    - If you can find and afford one, military surplus gas masks will combine this and the first item very effectively.
  
  3. Hair containment
    - Any sort of bandana or wave cap kept within a sealed pouch or baggie can help keep your hair out of your eyes and face.
  
  4. Water bottles
    - Water and water bottles are extremely good for many things. Naturally, you can use it to hydrate, but they have a few other uses.
    - They can be used to carefully wash your arms/face of tear gas particles without contaminating other water sources.
    - They can also be used to put out tear gas grenades if you're using the Traffic Cone method.
  
  5. Heat-resistant gloves
    - These are recommended in general, but are particularly helpful if you plan on turning tear gas against the police.
  
  6. Umbrellas
    - Umbrellas are particularly helpful for blocking the initial barrage of tear gas canisters, allowing you more time to either evacuate or retaliate.
    
  7. Traffic cones
    - Used mostly for the Traffic Cone method. Naturally.
    
  8. Rags
    - If all else fails, a wet rag can be used to cover a cannister and keep it from producing quite as much smoke.
 
 Alternative Tactics:
  These tactics are ONLY to be used by extremely prepared protestors. Take tremendous care when attempting any of these.
  
  1. The Traffic Cone method
    - The process is incredibly simple.
      **1. Place traffic cone over the cannister.**
      **2. Pour water into the cone to douse the cannister.**
    - This method gained popularity in Hong Kong, when the police force was using so much tear gas that people could feel its effects from three blocks away.
    - An ideal method for protestors looking to mitigate but not retaliate.
  
  2. Retaliation
    - IF you have heat-resistant gloves and are incredibly fast, you can throw the cannisters back at the police.
    - PLEASE understand that this is incredibly dangerous as it further provokes the police and may cause them to fire additional tear gas or rubber bullets.
    - Also understand that this will almost definitely get you arrested. Please take absolute care if you do this.
