What to do if you or a fellow protester is maced/pepper sprayed

Pepper Spray is a nonlethal deterrent very frequently used against protestors. Here are a few steps to help yourself and others recover from its effects.

DO:
  1. Leave the immediate area.
    - Pepper spray fumes can stay in the air for quite a while and continue to cause you grief.
  
  2. Avoid touching your eyes.
    - Rubbing your eyes will only make the irritation worse.

  3. Remove any affected clothing.
    - Most affected items are likely to be near your face. The fumes and any clothing that will be near your hands and face when you're trying to wash the pepper          spray out can exacerbate the situation.

  4. Use wetwipes or a wet rag to clean off the affected area.
    - I cannot stress this further: You do **not** want any excess chemicals getting on your face while you're trying to wash things off.
    
  5. Rinse your eyes out for 10-15 minutes with **plain, clean water**.
    - This may take up to or more than a litre of water. 
    - Plain filtered/clean water is ideal for washing out pepper spray, as it carries the lowest risk of carrying bacteria. 

Do NOT:
  1. Try washing out the pepper spray without cleaning your hands and arms.
    - You may have some of the chemicals still on your hands or forearms. This will just waste water while continuing to exacerbate the pain.
    
  2. Use milk to wash out the pepper spray.
    - Milk may help soothe the pain, but it won't do any more than water for washing out the chemicals.
    - Additionally, the bacteria in milk may cause you to get an eye infection. Avoid at all costs.
