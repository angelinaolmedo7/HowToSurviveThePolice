What to do if you are under attack by rubber bullets.

Rubber bullets are in incredibly dangerous 'nonlethal' deterrent method deployed by many PDs. These rounds are usually not made from rubber or feature it as a minor component at best, and tend to be made from materials such as plastic, wax, and wood. The bulk of our advice on this matter will be prevention and mitigation.

What to bring:
  1. Head Protection
    - Shatter-proof goggles are the most important piece of head protection you can have. Eye injuries from rubber bullets are exceedingly common, with over 268 instances of vision damage done during the 2019-2020 Chilean Protests alone.
    - Helmets of any kind will help mitigate head trauma done by rubber bullets. Bike helmets work, motorcycle helmets work better.
    
  2. Body Protection
    - Leather jackets, especially zipped up, can offer a surprising amount of protection. 
    - If overheating is not a concern, a light jacket or additional shirt layers worn underneath heavier jackets can offer additional protection and potentially save your ribs.
    
How to avoid:
  1. Watch the cops
    - It goes without saying, but if you see the police arming up with rifles of any sort you should be careful. No organized force fields weaponry if they're not prepared to use it.
  
  2. Police Scanners
    - If legally allowed by your state, stay tuned in to Police Scanners. They'll usually mention when they're going to start using Rubber Bullets.
  
  3. Listen to other protestors
    - Keep your ear to the ground and listen to others' experiences. If another group is being assualted by rubber bullet firing goons, they will almost always try to make that as widely known as possible.
    - Similarly, if your group is assaulted, post that on twitter and every other platform you can. Being prepared is a powerful thing.
